          <h1>// Starting a Group For Future Programmers</h1>
          <h4>10/01/2020</h4>
          <p>
            This week I received three separate messages from friends wondering how
            I learned programming and where to start.  The answer is that I was super
            lucky to be able to attend a bootcamp when I was 17 years old and sort of
            tricked my way into the tech industry.  It's not an uncommon path and it
            worked out really well for me, however, I think that if you really want
            to learn how to code you should be able to do so at your own pace using
            resources from the internet.  The frustrating thing to me is that the
            services that are online (at least the good ones) tend to ask for a 
            hefty subscription fee and if you don't pay for one of these services,
            the only way to really learn is to dig through messy documentation that
            doesn't really tell you how to actually put a website/game/piece of software
            together.  I figured, why not start a collaborative group where we can learn
            together?  A group for freely sharing useful information.
            <br/><br/>
            This is Code Commune Version 1.0.0 - a discord server for programmers and future programmers, open to 
            any and all who are interested in coding.  I will be hosting classes that will be
            available live and will also be posted online in video and text format.  I will 
            also be doing 1 on 1 code reviews, bug squashing, question answering, and whatever
            else folks need to be able to learn effectively.  I'm really excited about this
            project and I hope you consider joining.  Happy coding! <3
