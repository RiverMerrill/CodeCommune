          <h2>// Linking Javascript and HTML</h2>
          <h4>10/19/2020</h4>
          <p>
            In this video I talk about how to link your HTML and Javascript files to make your webpages dynamic.
            I also talk a little bit about the DOM (Document Object Model) and IF Satements.

          <h2>// The Shell</h2>
          <h4>10/16/2020</h4>
          <p>In the following video I go over some basics of using the shell.  Written instructions are below.</p>
          <div class="codegena">

          <br><br>
          <p>
            The shell is a program that presents a command line interface to let you control your computer by typing commands.
            I recommend using CMDER if you're on Windows and Terminal if you're on a mac.
            CMDER lets you use some more universal commands that aren't available on Windows by default.
            <br><br>
            A directory is the same thing as a folder on your computer.
            When you are using your shell, you will always have a current working directory, which is the folder that you're currently in.
            You can view, edit, and run files that are in the current working directory.
            Your shell will show you what directory you're in right before the prompt.
            The format of the directory is parentDirectory/childDirectory and these can be nested just like folders.
            When I refer to the root directory, I'm talking about the folder where the files and folders for your program are stored.  You always want to keep the files for your program or website in separate directories.
          </p>
          <h2>Let's go over some basic commands.</h2>
          <p>
            <br><br>
            `ls` shows you all the non hidden files and folders in your current working directory
            You can supply the argument -a (`ls -a`) which will show you the hidden files and folders as well.  Hidden files start with a `.`
            You can also give ls a path to the directory you want to list.
            <br><br>
            To navigate into a folder you use the command `cd`, which stands for "change directory".  You give the `cd` command a folder you want to navigate to and it will change your current working directory to the argument you give. Like so: `cd MyFolder`
            To navigate "backwards" or up a directory you use `..`.  `.` refers to the current working directory and `..` refers to the parent directory.
            <br><br>
            To create a directory, use the command `mkdir [name of folder]`, that will create a folder in the current working directory.
            To create a file, use the command `touch [name of file]`.
            <br><br>
            To open a file or folder, on windows use the command `start [name of file or folder]` and on mac use the command `open [name of file or folder]`.
            <br><br>
            To open Visual Studio code use the command `code [name of folder]`.
            <br><br>
            The `clear` command will clear out all the output that is currently displayed in the shell.
            <br><br>
            That's all I have for today.  Happy coding!

          <h1>// Session 1 - The Web Stack</h1>
          <h4>10/07/2020</h4>
          <p>
            Tonight, we talked about the web stack.  We discussed how the client passes data
            to the server and then moved on to HTML/CSS/Javascript fundamentals.  My audio is
            a little quiet in this one, I'll figure out my recording software before the next session.

          <h1>// Starting a Group For Future Programmers</h1>
          <h4>10/01/2020</h4>
          <p>
            This week I received three separate messages from friends wondering how
            I learned programming and where to start.  The answer is that I was super
            lucky to be able to attend a bootcamp when I was 17 years old and sort of
            tricked my way into the tech industry.  It's not an uncommon path and it
            worked out really well for me, however, I think that if you really want
            to learn how to code you should be able to do so at your own pace using
            resources from the internet.  The frustrating thing to me is that the
            services that are online (at least the good ones) tend to ask for a 
            hefty subscription fee and if you don't pay for one of these services,
            the only way to really learn is to dig through messy documentation that
            doesn't really tell you how to actually put a website/game/piece of software
            together.  I figured, why not start a collaborative group where we can learn
            together?  A group for freely sharing useful information.
            <br/><br/>
            This is Code Commune Version 1.0.0 - a discord server for programmers and future programmers, open to 
            any and all who are interested in coding.  I will be hosting classes that will be
            available live and will also be posted online in video and text format.  I will 
            also be doing 1 on 1 code reviews, bug squashing, question answering, and whatever
            else folks need to be able to learn effectively.  I'm really excited about this
            project and I hope you consider joining.  Happy coding! <3
